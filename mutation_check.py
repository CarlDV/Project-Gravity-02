"""Mutation check: break one thing at a time and prove a named test catches it.

A green suite only means the tests did not fire. This asserts they *would* fire, which is
the difference between a test and a comment. Runs entirely inside a throwaway copy of the
repo under the system temp directory; the real working tree is never modified.

    python3 mutation_check.py        (from anywhere)

Every entry below is a real regression somebody could plausibly introduce -- a reverted
`d.slot`, a clock swapped back to wall time, a change that lands in one tree and not the
other -- paired with the test that has to notice. A SKIP means the anchor no longer matches
the source, which is itself a finding: the mutation needs re-aiming at what the code says now.
